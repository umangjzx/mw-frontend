            The idea for MelodyWings was born from the shared experiences of a mother-daughter duo, Chitra and Nithila, during their time volunteering with His Mountain Top Ministries (<Link href="https://hismountaintopministries.com" target="_blank" className="font-semibold underline">HMM</Link>) through National Charity League Inc (NCL). {" "}
            <Link href="https://www.nationalcharityleague.org/chapter/granitebayarea" target="_blank" className="font-semibold underline">NCL, Granite Bay Area Chapter</Link> is a group of mothers and daughters who have come together in a commitment to community service for more than 35 non-profits, and HMM is one among them.
            HMM offers horse therapy for children with special needs.
            As "sidewalkers," Chitra and Nithila walked alongside the horses, ensuring the children's safety as they participated in therapeutic activities.

          They observed that one kid, despite struggling with stress and self-regulation, loved singing and had an exceptional voice.
          A few other children, despite having a limited attention span, enjoyed singing full rhymes with enthusiasm.
          Motivated by these experiences, Nithila decided to begin a research project in high school focused on the impact of music on children with special needs.
          This passion, combined with a love for music, inspired the creation of MelodyWings—a platform designed to help children explore their musical interests with the support of dedicated volunteers.
          Over time, MelodyWings expanded to offer a wide variety of subjects and skill-building opportunities, all tailored to the unique needs of children with special needs and developmental disabilities.
